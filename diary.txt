Present
	1.	Christian, Daniel, Oliver, Bernd
Agenda:
	1.	installation of diamonds
Subjects:
1.	DESY-CMS diamonds 
1.	Wolfgang Lange offered some changes 
1.	change of polarity
2.	change of high voltage
3.	test of CVDs
4.	detectors to be sent to Zeuten in mid October
2.	installation 
1.	left IP4 beam 1
3.	ROSI logging 
1.	two or one LAN connections to be checked
2.	ROSI GUI 
1.	all settings configurable by the user (see manual)
3.	ROSI server 
1.	subscription to server for data distribution to clients (data are identical to logging data)
4.	histogram
